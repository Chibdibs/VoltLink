# VoltLink: Peer-to-Peer Renewable Energy Trading Platform

## Introduction
VoltLink aims to revolutionize the way we think about and engage with renewable energy. By leveraging blockchain technology, VoltLink creates a decentralized platform that enables users to trade excess renewable energy directly with others in their community. This project not only promotes the use of renewable energy sources but also empowers individuals to take part in a sustainable energy ecosystem.

## How It Works
VoltLink uses a blockchain-based system to securely and transparently record transactions of energy trading. Participants with renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines, can sell their excess energy to others in the network. This peer-to-peer transaction is facilitated through our native digital currency, VoltCoin, ensuring a smooth, secure, and transparent process.
